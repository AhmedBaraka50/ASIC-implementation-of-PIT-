About PIT 
The Programmable Interval Timer Module, PIT, is a simple timer to generate a periodic signal for a microcontroller system. This signal may be used for a variety of purposes such as triggering the start of an Analog to Digital or Digital to Analog conversion, as a periodic system interrupt, or to synchronize the start of various other hardware processes.

The PIT core has 4 primary blocks:
•	WISHBONE Interface
•	Control Registers
•	Prescale Counter
•	Main Counter
